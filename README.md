## Development process
1. Brainstorm
2. Implement in branch{development}
3. Test(Fix bugs here if noticed before reported)
4. Release pre-release in branch{development}
5. Fix reported issues if any(If there are go back to step 2)
6. Merge branch{development} with branch{main}
7. Release a release version in branch{main}
## Notes 
1. The Java implementation is probably going to be the most stable as that is where things are first implemented
2. The Python implementation needs to be updated so use the deprecated interpreter2.py
