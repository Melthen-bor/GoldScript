You are not allowed to claim this project as your own. You are allowed to use this in your project with proper acknowledgement. Any project in which at least 69% of the files are explictly licensed under the OPLL has all its unlicensed files implicitly licensed under the OPLL. The explicit licensing of a file under the OPLL can not be retracted under any circumstances. Proper acknowledgement is the inclusion of an acknowledgement in a setup file for the application. Any fork of any project licensed under the OPLL must also be licensed under the OPLL. The version of the OPLL that a file is licensed under may not be changed to a previous version but may be changed to a subsequent version of the OPLL.
